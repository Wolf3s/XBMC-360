XBMC-360 Alpha 0.5
========================
This is a port of XBMC4XBOX to XBox 360 using the Microsoft XBox 360 SDK (not using Linux and Kodi).

This is only the bare skeleton of the application at the moment.

Current Status:
GUILIB: As of now only the bare basics of the guilib have been ported and missing many controls, however basic image and text controls 
are working.

DVDPLAYER: The FFMPEG based core named DVDPlayer is still missing sections/features and there is an issue with audio and video been slightly out of sync,
but it plays videos and works.

FFMPEG: The ffmpeg libraries included where ported to Xbox 360 by Ced2911. They are quite old (2011).
