Current Status:

GUILIB: As of now the basics of the GUILib have been ported and missing some control types, however the basic controls are there and working well.

DVDPLAYER: The FFmpeg based core named DVDPlayer is still missing sections/features, but it works well.

Note: The FFmpeg libraries included where ported to Xbox 360 by Ced2911, they are quite old (2011).
