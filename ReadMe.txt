XBMC-360 Alpha 0.5
========================
This is a port of XBMC4XBOX to XBox 360 using the Microsoft XBox 360 SDK (not using Linux and Kodi).

This is only the bare skeleton of the application at the moment.

Current Status:
GUILIB: As of now only the bare basics of the guilib have been ported and missing many controls, however the basic controls are working.

DVDPLAYER: The FFMPEG based core named DVDPlayer is still missing sections/features, but it works.

FFMPEG: The ffmpeg libraries included where ported to Xbox 360 by Ced2911. They are quite old (2011).
