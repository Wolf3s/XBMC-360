# XBMC-360 Alpha

This is a port of XBMC4XBOX to XBox 360 using the Microsoft XBox 360 SDK (not using Linux and Kodi).

This is early stages and still very much a work in progress.

### Current Status:
- GUILib - The main controls are working but still have some missing.
- VideoPlayer/DVDPlayer - Works well but needs improvements/features.

Usable but many features still need reimplementation or improvements.

### Compiled alpha build (last updated 21-04-25):
