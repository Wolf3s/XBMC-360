# XBMC-360 Alpha

This is a port of XBMC4XBOX to XBox 360 using the Microsoft XBox 360 SDK (not using Linux and Kodi).

This is early stages and still very much a work in progress.

### Current Status:
- GUILib - The main controls are working but still have some missing.
- VideoPlayer/DVDPlayer - Works well but needs improvements/features.

Usable but many features still need reimplementation or improvements.

### Compiled alpha build (last updated 4-3-22):

### Libraries
- LibSMB2 - Ported and working (currently not mappable from UI, this is my next task).

### Services
- FTP Server.
- NTP Client.

### Notes:
Special thanks to XBMC4XBOX and Kodi.
